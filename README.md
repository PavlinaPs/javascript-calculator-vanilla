# Build a JavaScript Calculator (Vanilla)

This is a vanilla JavaScript preparation for my React.js solution to the [Build a JavaScript Calculator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator), the fourth of 5 projects to earn the Front End Development Libraries certification. FreeCodeCamp's mission is to help people learn to code for free.

Fulfill the user stories and get all of the tests to pass. You can use any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and jQuery to complete this project.

## My process

I've already tried to code this challenge in React.js with useReducer hook but it never worked correctly, so I decided to code it vanilla first and it passes all FreeCodeCamp's tests. And also my husband's and children's fooling around :-)

### Built with

- vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

This was a nice JavaScript exercise, let's see if I can code it in React.js

### Continued development

I need to improve in React.js.
