# Build a JavaScript Calculator (Vanilla)

This is a vanilla JavaScript preparation for my React.js solution to the [Build a JavaScript Calculator]https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator), the fourth of 5 projects to earn the Front End Development Libraries certification. FreeCodeCamp's mission is to help people learn to code for free.

## My process

I've already tried to code this challenge in React.js with useReducer hook but it never worked correctly, so I decided to code it vanilla first and it passes all FreeCodeCamp's tests. And also my husband's and children's fooling around :-)

### Built with

- vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

This was a nice JavaScript exercise, let's see if I can code it in React.js

### Continued development

I need to improve in React.js.
